Hi everyone,

I had no luck finding a working mod to make the speeds of the vehicles more realistic and faster so I decided to make one of my own!
I took the values from an old mod and just added them to mine since those speeds seem to be perfect.

Below are the values that were changed:

Value changes:
Bicycle: 5,10 to 10,15. 50-60% faster
Minibike: 7,10 to 12,15. 50% faster
Motorcycle: 9,14 to 15,27. Double the speed.
4x4 Truck: 9,13 to 14,25 faster.
Gyrocopter: 7,10 to 7,45. These speeds will be quite fast when you are holding shift. Adjust a lower value if fps starts to lower.

If by any chance you do not like some of the values all you need to do is find "velocityMax" in the file and adjust the numbers. First number will be base velocity and second will be top velocity. 

Here's a quick example:

Original: property name="velocityMax" value="7, 45"/>
Edited: property name="velocityMax" value="8, 60"/>

Save and done!

How to Install:
Navigate to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\
Right click anywhere in your Directory and create New Folder, name it Mods
Drag and drop folder to your created mod folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods

Something to consider:
The Gyrocopter has a very hard time taking off at high speeds. I suggest that you accelerate to flight without holding Shift, then use shift when you're in the air.
