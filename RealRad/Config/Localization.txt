Getting wet in the wasteland will increase radiation absorption. \nPut on the Hazmat Suit or seek shelter to reduce the radiation dosage. \nBeing out of the Wasteland slowly decreases radiation, while clean rain or immersion in uncontaminated water will more effectively remove radioactive contaminants. \nIncreased radiation will make you weaker and more susceptible to injuries. 100% radiation will give you mortal injuries.",,,,
