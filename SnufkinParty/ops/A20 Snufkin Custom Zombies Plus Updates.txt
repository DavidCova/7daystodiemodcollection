Snufkin Zombies Plus - A20 Compatability Check List and Updates - The 16th of August, 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha 20.6 (b8)
This update required a buffs.xml update.
References for onSelfRangedBurstShot have been updated to onSelfRangedBurstShotEnd to match default values.
The effect is a delayed muzzle flash for the Juggernaut rocket launch and delayed explosion elimination for the Bomber. 


Generic
1. Zombie_Template mesh removed and updated to "Prefab" value="Z"
2. Cheer leader zombie removed from entitygroups.xml
3. Old Timer removed from entitygroups.xml
4. Stripper zombie renamed to zombiePartyGirl.
5. Farmer removed from entitygroups.xml
6. Renamed Pine Forest for day and night to new naming protocol and removed associated spawning.xml. Will need to watch carefully for rebalancing as they are linked to town and increased spawning potential.
7. Did not add a Wasteland Downtown for Plus Zombies as it may be excessive with default spawning. Will need to access.
8. Removed shark physicsbodies.xml as this entity was experimental from the original Snufkins.
9. Added Boss loot for Banshee and Juggernauts (was regular) and rebalanced overall loot drops.
10. Removed Quest Challenge for the Juggernaut to reflect A20 removals.
11. Updates to Add On entitygroups.xml (Lite, No Horde, etc) to reflect entity and biome changes. 

Original Snufkins (15)
1. Archon - No error warnings and appears to behave as usual. Wing attachment needed updating to the best alternative option.
2. Banshee - No error warnings and appears to behave as usual.
3. Bomber - No error warnings and detonation appears to be consistent for A20.
4. Cowhead - Required chainsaw buff changing from particle to prefab as particle has no connected texture. Removes the wavy effect but such is. No error warnings and appears to behave as usual.

6. Juggernaut - No error warnings and appears to behave as usual. Updates to attachments look consistent.
